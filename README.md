in the folder called frontend, you will find the files to put in a anvil frontend. We need to use a anvil frontend because we have done most of our development in Google Colab and anvil had a convenient API that allows us to connect a google Colab runtime directly to their frontend, acting as a fully python frontend

The anvil app can be accessed here from most browsers: https://VU6QEEN6ZEMMIF44.anvil.app/XC2R5RNF4Y6THMWFTL6B7EII
The colab is here: (view only)

note that you will need to get your own api keys for each of the ones we've used
